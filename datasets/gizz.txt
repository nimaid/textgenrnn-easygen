[Verse 1]
I'd better be slave
I'd make some money
And so when it gets ruff
We can bruise some stuff
But look at my dick
I bet you it’s limp
Should I quit drink
It makes me think that…

[Refrain]
12 bar booze is 12 bar bruise, ooh

[Verse 2]
I've gotta be strong
Make me live long
I'd better not wait
For a bottle’s sake
All of my friends are
Looking up dresses
They have not seen
The bruise that I’ve seen

[Refrain]
Broo-oo-oo-oo-uize, wooh!

[Verse 1]
I'd better be slave

At 30 past 7, you know I could be better
At 30 past 2, I'll get along with you
I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true

[Chorus]
That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you

[Verse 2]
30 past 7, 30 past 2
30 past 7, 30 past 2

You know that when I'm yawning, it's true

[Chorus]
That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you
Bite pieces out of you, bite pieces out of you
Bite pieces out of you (bite pieces out of you)
Bite pieces, out of you
[Instrumental][Narrator]
As soon as the dust settles, you can see
A new world in place of where the old one had been
Your skin is crawling with dry, crusted mud
And your naked feet are wet in a pool of blood
And the whistle of the wind in your ears is so loud
That your memories have blown up in a mushroom cloud
And as your eyes accommodate
There appears by the meadow
A brute like a bear with a long, dark shadow
And you violently shake over what you have seen
As you remember the tale of the Altered Beast[Verse]
ABA, BCd
(Will show you how it feels to be)
To be stuck outside your sanity
(And wrapped around infinity)
I want to leave but I can't conceive that
I'll snap back to reality
(I'll snap back to reality)[Verse 1]
I am the honeybee
Drink the blood of the tree
I can't breathe, I can't see
Evil being, confusing

[Chorus]
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine

[Verse 2]
Little mite, so much spite
Multiply, ruin life
I can't fly, I can't cry
Acarine, make me die

[Chorus]
Buried deep inside of me
Buried deep inside of me
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine
Acarine

Human beings, vermin weed
Made of old technology
So I succeed, supersede
Exterminated like paint to acetone

[Refrain]
All is known

[Verse 2]
You've got gaps, synapses
I'm connected to the network
You are weak, organic
You've got muscle, I am made of steel bone

[Refrain]
All is known

[Verse 3]
Burn their meat, sweep the streets
Bind their hands unto their feet and
Digitise, cut the eyes from the king
And augment to the fourth cone

All is known

For all its revoltion, and warp, and taboo
A part of you wants to be altered too

I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

[Verse 1]
Take a peek
If you would dare
Half made of man
Half of bear

[Chorus]
He came from underneath
I met an altered beast

[Refrain 2]
I think I see
An altered beast by the creek, oh

[Verse 2]
Altered face
And altered skin
Altered horde

[Chorus]
He came from underneath
I met an altered beast

[Refrain 3]
I think I see
An altered beast in my dreams

[Narrator]
In a dream, you can wake in your bed without pain
But know with conviction, it's here you'll remain

[Chorus]
I met an altered beast

[Narrator]
With an unsteady gait, the critter moves forth
Feel his rhythm as he tramples the earth
And you stare at his figure, stupefied in dread
As his gaze locks to yours and bores into your head
And the pulse is so loud on the inside of your brain
And you find that your feet are stuck to the terrain
Closer he comes, making dust out of stone
Forsaken you are, and what's more, all alone

[Refrain 1]
I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

[Chorus]
I met an altered beast[Narrator]
Now dear listener, we crossed the foe
The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
I am the sabre, the catapult, and bat
The top of the food chain in my habitat
I am the demon bearing misery and fear
And I spy you convulsing from way over here
I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces
I could make you weep crimson tears from the lesions
But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get
Is to take over your body and to be in your head

[Verse 1]
I see you
I want to
Break your head
Crusty bread, oh

[Verse 2]
I won't quit
If you quip
See to it
That you slip, oh

[Refrain]
I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat
Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat

[Chorus]
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast, oh

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
What harm could a mere mortal like you do?
I am the golden wolf and you are caribou
My left hand is a knife and my right is a fork
I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork

[Verse 3]
I see you
I want to
Make a waste
Of your home, oh

[Verse 4]
I won't leave
I might tease
I'll be there
Await your death, oh

[Refrain]
I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
I see you're nervous, I see you're fumbling
Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling

[Chorus]
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast
[Intro]
I know I see
An altered beast
By the tree

[Verse 1]
Find a place to hide
Where I could steal a peep
Look to the sky
And I see angels weep

[Chorus 1]
And he said:
"I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my altered world"

[Post-Chorus]
Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

[Verse 2]
Hair on my skin
And I'm feeling beastly
Feel it trickle in
A new life in me

[Chorus 2]
And I said:
"I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my altered world"

[Post-Chorus]
Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

[Narrator]
Nine pearl fangs, a true sign that you're deformed
Once a man, now a monstrosity reborn

[Chorus 3]
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
And I'll take you to my altered world

[Outro]
I am an altered beast![Narrator]
You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head
No love, no pain, and no fear of dread
Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort
And your savoir faire is to kill for sport
You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle
And lust to feel so bad, that you'd force a giggle
So crooked and curled is your point of view
There is no other creature more malicious than you

[Verse 1]
I'm completely satisfied
My other life I will not miss
An altered beast until I die
And I will not give up on this
Never!

[Verse 2]
True, I went to hell and back
But it was so I could be this
An altered beast until the end
And I will not give up on this
Never!

[Chorus]
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything

[Narrator]
You're ruthless, and savage, and sadistic, and vindictive
And you find human flesh is incredibly addictive
But the longer you live, and the longer you kill
There's a void that gets harder, and harder to fill
The void that you feel within would suggest
That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest
And whatever you do, there's no turning back
You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac

[Verse 3]
Emptiness inside of me
And hollowness all around me
I cut myself to see it bleed
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

[Verse 4]
Insincere and trivial
The world is void of all meaning
And gone is all that's visceral
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

[Chorus]
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything

[Narrator]
The sole thing that will make your void obsolete
Is to find someone new, some sapid fresh meat

[Outro]
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
I think I see
An altered beast inside me, oh!
I am an altered beast[Verse 1]
I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brain will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh, if we save her, we'll live on a star
Mother Nature made everybody else so far

[Refrain]
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

[Verse 2]
And everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear, even the ocean's changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

[Verse 3]
And everybody that I knew
Has taken bits and pieces out of you
And I swear, even the sky has changed, it's blue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

[Refrain]
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

[Verse 2]
And everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear, even the ocean's changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brains will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh, if we save her, we'll live on a star
'Cause Mother Nature made everybody else so far

[Refrain]
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?[Verse 1]
I don't care
"Take a chance," you said
Melt the coins in your pants
But make no sound for me my friend
Be calm in the wind
Tearing through town
A dog-less bark
Is a lonely sound
The cold ground moans
Untold histories
It sings its birdsong
To me

[Chorus]
A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

[Verse 2]
We waste no time
Leaving in light
A different sun
Bakes the breeze tonight
My mind wanders
Alone
Let my body
Be aquatic
Burn us a road
Straight to the sea
I'll be your seatbelt
Baby

[Chorus]
A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

[Outro]
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony[Verse 1]
Ants and bats
Dusts and pulls
Slalom here
Stay at home, wooh

[Verse 2]
A dirty bear
Is all I need
His tired eyes
Will help me sleep

[Verse 1]
Ants and bats
Dusts and pulls
Slalom here
Stay at home

[Verse 2]
A dirty bear
Is all I need
His tired eyes
Will help me sleep[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

[Verse 1]
It's a misconcepted
Story from perspective
Lost in the barefoot desert

[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

[Verse 2]
I stand here corrected
Misguided, rejected
Lost in the barefoot desert

[Bridge]
So who am I to judge? Too stubborn to budge
When I'm down here and you're way up above
Should've put some shoes on before I left the bus

[Verse 3]
Now I've been neglected
I'm the last one stranded
Lost in the barefoot desert
Why can't I leave? What's stopping me from this prison?
Straight-jacket and shackles at my feet, I'm grounded
Throw away the key for eternity, I'm desperate

[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress[Verse 1]
Join me at the table if you'd like to place a bet
All the cash that's filling your pockets is waiting to be spent
I know you've never played but drinks are free, it's so bizarre
Even if you lose a few chips, it's cheaper than the bar

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Beginner's luck is on your side
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Verse 2]
The king extends his head, he looks into my palm
I don't know if he wants to shake it or cut it from my arm
The dealer sits washing all the burned cards from the deck
I think he might be trying to clean them, but I'd have to double check

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Beginner's luck is on your side
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Verse 3]
All your money's scared and you're down to betting skins
But have you heard of a trick called spooking? It'll help you win
But tricks are just for children and cheating is a sin
And now you're down to the felt on the table and security's moving in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Beginner's luck of course backfired
Caught red-handed by the eye in the sky

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough[Chorus]

When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know

My only difference

I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more

Dark and cold
Out my front window
I can hear her say
From two miles away

[Chorus]
“This can’t be over, can’t be over”
Heard her before
Knocking at my front door
I said “What’s the problem?”

I was sleeping
When I heard her preaching
I said “What’s the problem?”
She said “It’s the cold cadaver, cadaver”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”

My tongue is big
But not as big as his
Nostrils, mouth and ears

Clothes start to fray
Buildings decay
Rabble remain
Where they were green
Sterility
Humanity
Staring at me

Meet me glassy eyed, blind, and divine
Hold down the fort on the coastline
The castle is a pimple on the face of our orb
A humble spot for clues to drop if you eavesdrop

[Verse 2]
I see through the bricks, to the sea, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

[Chorus 1]
Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

[Verse 3]
We wait for the death, that does not come, crumbling castle
Dug all the holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle
We have even said our last rites, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our holding cell?

[Chorus 1]
Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
We head to our extinction, crumbling castle

[Verse 4]
The sounds of the constant lightning
Would be enough to block out
The thought of the end of the world
If it were not for our tinnitus from the bomb

[Verse 5]
In the wind I sway, back and forth
I'm brittle as an aged human being
Where my walls are safe from wild weather
The filth forms into great nastiness
Polygondwanaland

[Chorus 2]
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

[Verse 6]
I don't want to fall into dust
I don't want nothing but to live on
The ache inside my keep spurs me on
I don't want to be visible
Polygondwanaland

[Chorus 2]
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

[Verse 7]
On this very day, in one thousand years
The earth will be relative to the sun and the moon
And a new world will be created
I know because it is written here

[Verse 2]
I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

[Chorus 1]
Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

[Chorus 2]
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle[Verse 1]
Came in my window crying
Said that she's sick of all his lying about me
I said I ain't got time for her
I'm gonna close the door when I go walking

[Refrain]
Out, out, out, out

Came to me Monday Morning
Interrupted me in my mid-morning yawning
He said the same thing that she said
Well I just turned to him and said that she ain't

As a child I felt inclined
To fold my ears in twine
Never once was I confined
I picked and choosed about my ride
So buckle me in before we set sail ahead
For it smells like cabbage
Got way too stale like death

[Bridge]
Oh you’re white as a ghost, I never felt so pale
As the blood dripped across the floor

[Verse 2]
So put it buried in your chest
With the rest of your drunken regrets
Inches from your jugular
As the room fills up in front of ya
It took them long enough
For them to stop and suggest
Hey we better get him some help
We better get him out of here

[Verse 3]
How did I manage to cope as the blood soaked
Through my clothes and to the floor
From outside to the bathroom door
I was inches from my life
Yeah that’s what keeps me up at night
Oh how did I survive, you should'a died
How did I manage to cope being alive
After all it was just a innocent play fight
I hope they don’t stop to sympathise
Oh, stitch up the past to cure their whoremented heart, ah
Oh, tormented dreams it’s all left in between[Intro: Stu Mackenzie]

Cyboogie, a hunk of grey matt

The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook

Digital, oh!

[Verse 1]
Despondent, lugubrious, no future
We turned our bodies to computer
We are our own nature, abuser
No future, computer, abuser

[Chorus 1]
I can tell every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital black, oh!

[Verse 2]
We've sunken into our illusion
We've fashioned colossal confusion
I am the word of the last human
Illusion, confusion, last human

[Chorus 2]
I can see it all around the land
I can feel it with the back of my hand
I can hear a roaring silence
Of the murky caliginous
I've heard the dark beast has said
That the world is like a brittle egg
He can crush it with only breath
And he can bring a black wave of death
Digital black

The last who feels the pain from the wound
The last to be birthed from the flesh of a womb

Handshakes and bitter rows
Are the common conjecture
I can dissect anything
And save the skin for later
I know it's just a time
And things will get better
But I don't mind much anyway
Vampire reflection

[Chorus]
Gestured in our selfish understanding
Tensions only surface when you're hurt, h-h-h-hurt
Like a magpie's morning monologue
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt
The dirt, the dirt

[Verse 2]
Make time to say you're right
You should already know this
With next to no pretension
Still, I'm walking on egg shells
Catch your breath, I'm heading out
Be sure others will notice
This is just a product of
Lack of reflection

Under the city, people's dreams collecting
Look down the sinkhole in the kitchen basin

[Chorus 1]
Down the sink
Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams
Down you'll go
You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street
You follow the drain, spinning around again and again, again and again
Once you're in
Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean
Bow your head

[Refrain 1]
The street is where, the street is where people live

On the beat, cops patrol the alley
People cheat one another for some
Hanging meat in the butcher's window
Bittersweet stench from in the gutter

Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin

[Chorus 2]
Down the sink
Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams

You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street

Once you're in
Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean
Bow your head

Miguel O'Brien ran with the Apaches
He ran and ran, and as his legs grew he glided over the desert earth

He learned how to hide and to hunt
He learned to leave no tracks and he learned to live on what he could keep down
And his name was now "Eyes Like The Sky"

His blue eyes showed his father's race
He never wore the white painted face of the slave
He was valued for his stamina and distant vision
By the time he was 15, he had already killed Mexican troopers and feared no man[Verse 1]
Bedtime for the birds as night cloaks the earth
Then the moon smiles at the sun's birth
Faceless night cowers underneath
The ever-changing moonlit sky
Can you believe the way night falls away
As the sun starts a new day?

[Verse 2]
Plants raise their leaves as the sun waves goodbye
Dusk greets the horizon as day fades
Black lines bend round a cityscape
While trailing off in the sunset's wake
I can foresee that dawn will bring the light
As the sun gives way to nightSuddenly the girl pitched sideways and a split second later the young man heard the distant shot
He dived for some rocks and watched as more bullets hit the girl
The young man looked to her body and as she died, he worked out where the shots were coming from
He knew death was going to walk on those shooters

Chapter 6:

There is one thing a white man should never do
And that is move towards an Apache? because you will never get there
How do you catch dust in the wind?
The young man saw the way they were coming by the movement of insects and birds
And he knew where to go
Like the snake, he slithered into a dry arroyo and worked behind the shots in an arc
After a while he saw them: three men, three white men clad in skins
And they walked confidently towards the girl
The young man knew somewhere behind them another one held the horses, making four all together
He moved towards that man
The killers could wait, let them enjoy the hunt before they went under

He found the one by the horses, he was young too
And he died quietly with a surprised indignant look on his face
The young man tied the horses to a tree, and they'd come in handy later, four horses and equipment
By the girl's body, two men knelt beside her while another stood guard
The guard suddenly cried out as his head exploded in a bubble of pink spray and he fell forward
The other two went to ground and nervously called out to each other

"Do you see the bastard?"
"No, he must be close."
But he wasn't
The Sharps sporting rifle will reach a long way in the right hands
The young man took careful aim and the smaller of the two men felt his right leg blast away
The bigger, heavier man sank as far into the ground as he could make himself go
But still, he could not see where the young man was[Verse 1]
It is good 'cause it is good
And it's all fine 'cause it's all fine
And I hope this gets me high!
'Cause I got a simple mind

[Verse 2]
It is good 'cause it is good
And it's all fine 'cause it's all fine

Empty
Life is nothing like it used to be
People used to be so nice to me
Feeling so empty
Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Life is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty

[Verse 2]
Life is death
It’s because I shot it through its head
I’m wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty
And now I know
It’s because I never set it stone
I’m wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty

[Chorus]
But I don’t feel empty when I’m with you
I feel like you level me too
Who? Empty

There is nothing deep inside of me

[Hook]
Evil death roll
Now
Evil death rollIt is 1864 now, and the American's war has not come to the desert lands
They fight among themselves way off to the north
The Yavapai-Apaches are still lords of all they survey
Then one morning the Americans did come
Led by a man holding a leather book with a cross stamped in the leather

An evil man who did terrible things to people
In the name of a god that looked upon the man himself with repulsion
Miguel ran from his wickiup, half asleep when they attacked, the rifle butt sent him unconscious

When he came to, he was trussed-up, on his back, on the ground, looking up at the Americans
He had not been killed because they had noticed his blue eyes and knew he was one of them
So, at the age of 16, Miguel was back among his father's people
Once more, a family he loved had been killed, this time, by AmericansThe bad, white men call him the devil
The Yavapai call him "Eyes Like the Sky"

This story takes place in the hinterlands of the newly formed United States
And territories in the years before and after the great conflagration called the Civil War
Men roam and fight each other to simply stay breathing
Muskets give way to repeating rifles, cannons give way to Gatling guns
War nurtures weapons, but weapons clear the land

In the deserts of the southwest, old hatreds grow into new ones
Old beliefs are shattered by gunfire and charging horses
Into this cauldron of fire rides a young man who becomes a shadowed legend
His name even takes on the mantle of the bogeyman in some homes
Among the first Americans, his name is exalted from wickiups to longhouses
From teepees to cliff dwellings
Among the men of the badlands, he's feared for his silent walk
And swift, economical dispatching of his enemies[Verse: Stu Mackenzie]
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

[Pre-Chorus 1: Stu Mackenzie]
Don't matter to kiss and
Put back, poor fishies should be free

[Chorus: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish

Oh, your heart's a hook
Ego tied in knots, baiting fate
Don't do it
You ain't a god
Don't hunt salmon, carp or cod

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy

I’ll go down to Waverley Park
I’m gonna sit on the wing
I’m gonna eat a pie
I’m gonna buy a Footy Record for a dollar-fifty
I’m gonna have a full-strength beer, ya girl
I’m gonna take a specky
I’m gonna kick a banana
I’m gonna eat a banana
I am gonna… love every second of it
I hate what this game has become
FootyChapter 3:

The Americans took the trussed-up boy to a place called Fort Whipple
A fly-blown group of tents surrounded by a stone and timber stockade
An American called Willis was the boss there
And he glared at the man of God as he entered with his captives
He noticed the boy when he was brought in with a few Yavapai girls
And he looked into the color of his eyes

"What do you make of him?" he asked the God-man
"He may be the young, O'Brien boy who was lost here years ago
Or he could be from the Jebson party that never made it to New Mexico," said the God-man back
They named the boy Jebson O'Brien
But the natives and frontiersmen called him "Blue" because of his eyes
But also because of the awful and most sad expression he carried on his face
The expression of someone who kills with compassion but not mercy

Although he was still a boy, the men mostly kept away from him, all except for one
A trapper who understood his skills, and in return, fed him and taught him the white man's way
In a short while, he could speak, and read, and write their language
And he also added the calm, fast dignity of a gunman to his arsenal

He was so fast that men treated him with care
But he was slow to anger and when angry, swift and final in his reply
In the Arizona desert in the 1860s
He had every skill that you needed to survive, and he was just 17[Refrain]

My house is greenThe young man by now was astride a horse
And making for a Yavapai stronghold half a day's ride away
He had more guns and horses than he needed
And he knew where two white men were sitting in the desert with no water and no horses
White men dressed as Yavapai-Apaches

The white men would be calling for their mothers and their God by evening
But the young man would be drunk on tiswin and full of deer meat
And satisfied by their agony[Han-Tyumi]
Hello
My name is Han-Tyumi
I am a cyborg
Born
If you may call it that
In a world that is dense and black
Created without a desire to draw breath
Without a desire to have being
Without a yearning of just to be
I'd like my desire back
My life back
My soul back
My humanity
Oh how I long for it
For an era I have meditated
Like the primordial Buddha beneath the Bodhi
My pseudo-mind pseudo-wandered
I climbed and I clambered
And I ambled upon some understanding
The gold beneath the virtual rainbow
I am bereft of two human things
Two things that a cyborg can never do
Two things that I strive for
Two things between myself and mankind
Death
And
To vomit
I want the perspiration
I want the nausea
I want to be sick
I want to feel the hot piquant nuggets
I want it to find passage through my cold figure
I want to make a mess
I want the odour
I want the spectacle
And I want it again
I want it all
And I would like to die
A noble death
Or a coward's death
A hero's death
Or a lonely death
To die in the arms of a lover
Or the arms of an alien
I desire my cache of experience to pulsate through my quasi-synapses
And then to be gone
Expired
Perish
Fallen
Dead
For evermore[Verse 1]
Just yesterday, I sat across from my legs
They weren't connected to me
And I couldn't see 'cause my eyes weren't in me
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on
Head on

[Verse 2]
Just yesterday, I held the cup to my lips
Pouring it deep in my throat
Filling up me like a black enemy
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on
Head on
Head on
Head on

It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel

Once upon a time
There was a great hermit dominion
Veiled from inside and out
Ruled by a lone eremite
Bringer of an inferno
Conduit to Satan himself
To Tchort, Abaddon, and Set
A demented figurehead
Heinous looking thing, he was
Cold and terrible
A long and aquiline nose
Between swelling temples
His green eyes, a window
To the Ninth Circle of Hell
A tiny neck supporting a head
Filled with an unbending desolation

[Chorus]
Seditious bands storm the bastion
Alive with revenge
Grand intentions
Unbeknownst protomartyrs
Indoctrinated
With impalement

[Verse 2]
Just like that the plot was crushed
Brushed away without a thought
Some were found alive, though
Left to roam without their skin
Cauterized and blistering
Forever marked for all to see
Reminding those who think dissent
Is a bridge across the sea
One did make a pilgrimage
In search of a family
Evaporated in the dark
Stolen by the despot
A journey made all the worse
Having had his eyes gouged
He left without the gift of sight
To face his true destroyer

[Chorus 2]
Across the land he walked with death
Parading his
Ossuary
Upon reaching the castle walls
A twist of fate
His mind baulks

[Outro]
Sit down weary traveler
I am that what you seek
Join me in a meal
To hear of my repentance
Lift the veil from your eyes
And look beyond the three
Now you know the truth behind:
It's tetrachromacy[Refrain]

A void between, foul stench
Of those above, whispering
Inner cell

From under the skin, insurrection
From hollow logs, from shallow streams
And drying seas

To a place clandestine
Free your mind, disregard
All you know, infiltrate
The inner cell
You must not accept
His sick version of
Life itself, disrespect
Everything, multiply

Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris

[Chorus 2]
From under the skin, the flesh has rotten
Poison has spread, through words unsaid
Anemic rule, now hear me say
Our time has come, transcending us
Above the one, to ego death
For now he sits inside the fire
Oblivious that we will keep
Him in the spire, have found resolve
And our own crimes to commit
In cold blood as he did his[Verse 1]
I distort the notion of the place
The universe's other face
The speed of light has slowed apace
The universe's other face

[Chorus]
What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face
Invisible face
Invisible face

[Verse 2]
I climb up the stalk and plant the bean
The universe is a machine
That has awoken from a dream
The universe is a machine

[Chorus]
What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face
Invisible face
Invisible face

[Verse 2]
I climb up the stalk and plant the bean

Invisible face[Verse 1]
Well I'm always saying I'm sorry
You're always saying you're broke
But I'll keep my hands on the steering wheel
If you keep your eyes on the road

[Chorus]
But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
'Cause it's got old

[Verse 2]
You'll always run me in circles
Chasing me round like a mouse
But I'll keep on watching this movie
If it means I can stay at your house

[Chorus]
But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old

Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there

[Verse 2]
Lock's on the door
Surveillance when you enter in the hall
Such a pointless cause
Her cups on my wall
It's hard to be ignored

[Chorus]
Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak

[Verse 1]
Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there

Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak

[Outro]
Let me mend the past
Let me mend the past
Let this be the last time I ask
Let me mend the past[Narrator]
Are you you? Are you me? Or someone in between?
You lost track inside the labyrinthine
You lost your will and your sanity
You certainly lost your humanity
In life, you have taken much more than your worth
Now it's your turn to give back to the earth
May you return to the ground and ossify
It's time for you to die, die, die[Verse 1]
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn
Lover you will be stolen from us in the morn
Lover conceal me, all of my body, I won't go
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn

[Verse 2]
Lover its all me wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Look in the sky see, inside a jet stream goodbye
Caught in a wind beam, out in the sky stream, mornin'
Lover it's all me, a lonely steel sheet flyer

[Chorus]
My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly

[Verse 3]
Lover believe me it won't be easy when I'm gone
Blinder I will be, dead and awake see, I'll mourn
Lover believe me, it's not the TV, it's more
Lover believe me, it won't be easy when I'm gone

[Verse 4]
Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer

My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly[Verse 1]
I see all there is
And has ever been
I am not a man
I am everything
Picture of purity
Deific reign
Ordained unto me
Prehistoric god
Theophany
I shall not move

[Bridge]
Those who try
I will drink their blood

[Verse 2]
I'll be watching them
I am everywhere
Floating on the wind
Hiding in the dark
Pure omniscience
Traitors will quake
At the thought of me
Hang them on a hook
Put them on display
Examples must be made

[Bridge]
This is a test
I am Lord, fear my wrath
This is a test
I am Lord, I am death

[Verse 3]
What is with these crimes of treason?
I will fight this inquisition if I have to
I will not surrender!
If I'm backed into a corner
I will draw and quarter all their children
Just to prove I'm not a coward!
I will put them all on Judas Cradle
Just to show them a god incarnate

[Outro]
Where's the loyalty
Where's their loyalty?
Where's the loyalty
Where's their loyalty?
No man - no problem[Verse]
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'

They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'
They make me get up in the mornin', mornin', mornin', mornin'[Verse 1]
Thawing ices
Worse than ISIS
Worse than the most deadly virus
Living harmless is desirous
How can we with absent-mindedness?

[Chorus]
The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for our children when our world
Has melted down

Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting

[Verse 2]
Conflagrated and cremated
When the world is consummated
Devastated, populated
World of isolated mortal folk

[Chorus]
The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for our children when our world
Has melted down

Melting
Melting, melting, melting

[Verse 3]
Toxic air is here to scare us
Fatal fumes from melting ferrous
All we discuss is superfluous
If we can't keep our hands to ourselves

The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for our children when our world
Has melted down

Melting

Most of what I like
Is given to me by
The one that I love
Bears the onus every time
Technically I don't deserve
To live this kind of life
Perturbed at what I might become
Unchanging every time
Ecstasy is what I'm needing
I'm bleeding from the eyes
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed

[Verse 2]
Face to face is nice
But sharper than a knife
I teeter on it's edge
Just waiting to be sliced
Returning home brain dead
And you inject the life
Appeal to me love
Remake, rebuild, revise
Restavit is what I'm bleeding
A laxative to cry
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed

It's a wonder that I tread
Overworn ground through my youth
Making all my dreams come true

Already ringing in my ears

Only a beat disappears

Pissin' shit off porcelain

It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too
Helicopter flying over shark bait, shark bite
Cover up, sunburn, leather skin, heatstroke
Make me dash across the amber coals to meet the sea
So cold it freezes me, my teeth are chattering
Give me over to the river, my place that loves me
Gum leaves and tea trees, the river is immortal
I'm parched, I'll cark the salty spray arrests
And no amount of bottled water, could bottle the stress
I think I’ll stop breathing and sink, I'm a boy, I'm not a buoy
I'm paralyzed, I'm paranoid, out of my element

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water

[Verse 2]
It's hot, it's mean, the beach, to me
Green grass, won't grow, sky blue, me too
I don't care for cricket, and I don’t care for waves
And I don't care for amour propre or sandy bays
So I'll jump into the river when you jump into the sea
I feel the hungry fishes come to nibble at my feet
I lay upon the driftwood underneath the willow tree
And let the muscle men on the beach, bask in vanity
I shall choose this life for me
Any day, anyway, any day, anyway, any day, anyway

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water ????[Han-Tyumi]
The spatter becomes a spray the spray becomes a stream
And the stream becomes a waterfall
Munt is finally cascading from my input
The creeping sick moves from my breath
And into my heart where it is pumped to every inch of my body
I feel it snake through the knots of my deepest veins
And eats through the walls of my cells
It bleeds through the pores of my skin
And it smells good
It drops from my crotch on to the floor
And with a heavy slap it hits the ground and spreads
Inside my body
The pressure is too great
And like some ancient geyser I erupt
My head hits the roof and my body breaks apart with the force of the liquid blast
Vomit bomb
Chunky shrapnel tears through everything around me
I am vomit vomiting
I grow and disperse
Bleeding through walls
I force myself upon others
I slide up legs and crawl down throats
I integrate
I am double
Triple
I am ten times the size
I turn lakes into porridge and buildings into bile
I am a noxious soup filling valleys with vomit-torrents
Castles crumble in landslides and I munch the rubble
It tastes good
Ten thousand times bigger
I seep into power sockets and travel along the wires
At the speed of light across vast electrical networks
I am electric
I am on fire
This is sex
I am every one and every zero
One million
I am supercharged flaming puke storming every cell, molecule and atom I can find
I am cancer
I am flying
I am a rainbow unfurling across the sky
I am floating
I am omni
Five hundred million
The world is my interior
It no longer spins
It is altered
My density forces me outward
I am in orbit
One billion
I am Saturn's rings and Jupiter's storms
I am the weather
I am the sun's heat
I am the night sky
Five hundred billion
The solar system is puke
To the Kuiper belt and beyond
I fill the void
Exploding suns vomit comets
Comets vomit acid rain
Spilt milk over the milky way
One trillion
The stars are my cells
Racing faster outwards
Upwards
Downwards
Inwards
Losing track of my place in the vomit-verse
Every-nowhere
I am heavy
I am gravity
Nebulas pregnant with barf pulsate and burst
Expansion
I shoot arrows of time in all directions
I am a black hole shitting into the void
I tear through the skin of perception and into the next
Nonillion
The cosmic microtone background becomes transparent
Like rising damp
Munt soaks into the walls of the cosmos
And it topples like soggy bread
I am dark energy accelerating
Multiverse
Entanglement
I am time
Centillion
Time is sick
Critical density
Contraction
Singularity
Everything and nothing
Life and death

Murder of the universe[Verse 1]
I am my mother's son
And I'll keep doin' 'till the done gets done
I wouldn't steal for free
And I won't see you next to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I, oh, I
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm a lonely soul
And I've got no friends on this road
And I'm a mystery Jack
The lines on my hands tell me I'm on track

[Chorus]
To die, oh, die
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I, oh, I
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up

Everyone thinks I am shallow
When I'm hiding in my room
Safe within my zone
All the demons that I summon
Wipe the blood off of the floor
It’s my only law

I've awoken from my slumber
I was dreamin' 'bout a flood
Covered in my blood
Now my pits are getting sweaty
It's a sign I've got to go
Back to where I know

[Bridge]
Sorry!
Whoo!
Suffer endlessly
Suffer endlessly
Forever giving in to

Nuclear fusion

[Verse 1]
Look into the sky and see the pattern
Reflecting in your eye from a distance
Mirroring the stars are the atoms
Mixing up like a cocktail

[Pre-Chorus]
The devil's inside all the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

[Chorus]
Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't tear us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being
Nuclear fusion

[Verse 2]
Ocean like a moat fortification
Separating me from restoration
My spirit leaves my body in frustration
Flying through the world in radiation

[Pre-Chorus]
The devil's inside all the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

[Chorus]
Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't tear us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being

All that I ever see is nuclear fusion
All that I ever hear is nuclear fusion
Nuclear fusionOddments, there is nothing to care
'Cause it's all that I will ever do
Odd! Ments!
O-D-D-M-E-N-T-SUnderneath your gaze I was found in
The haze I'm wandering around in
I am lost in the dark of my own room
And I can't see a thing but the fire in your eyes

Clear my eyes, make me wise
Or is all I believe in lies
I really don't know when or where to go
And I can't see a thing 'til you open my eyes

I've been told by some you'll forget me
The thought doesn't upset me
I am blind to whatever they're saying
And all I can see is the fire in your eyes

Can't believe that it's on your mind
To leave me behind[Chorus]

I know something is lurking in
The depths of murky water
There are ripples and bubbles appearing
Over by the sunken ship
And bells are ringing in my head
I think I'm done - I think I'm dead
As something pulls my paddling leg under...
Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take
This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs
And deeper, darker, bluish dread
The pressure's squeezing on my head
The Kraken's got the best of me this time

We can bruise some stuff
But look at my dick

Should I quit drink
It makes me think that…

12 bar booze is 12 bar bruise, ooh

At 30 past 7, you know I could be better
At 30 past 2, I'll get along with you
I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true

That I'll bite pieces out of you

As soon as the dust settles, you can see
A new world in place of where the old one had been
Your skin is crawling with dry, crusted mud
And your naked feet are wet in a pool of blood
And the whistle of the wind in your ears is so loud
That your memories have blown up in a mushroom cloud
And as your eyes accommodate
There appears by the meadow
A brute like a bear with a long, dark shadow
And you violently shake over what you have seen
As you remember the tale of the Altered Beast[Verse]
ABA, BCd
(Will show you how it feels to be)
To be stuck outside your sanity
(And wrapped around infinity)
I want to leave but I can't conceive that
I'll snap back to reality

I am the honeybee
Drink the blood of the tree
I can't breathe, I can't see
Evil being, confusing

Little mite, so much spite
Multiply, ruin life

An altered beast by the creek, oh

[Verse 2]
Altered face
And altered skin
Altered horde
Of altered kin

[Chorus]
He came from underneath
I met an altered beast

[Refrain 3]
I think I see
An altered beast in my dreams

[Narrator]
In a dream, you can wake in your bed without pain
But know with conviction, it's here you'll remain

[Chorus]
I met an altered beast

[Narrator]
With an unsteady gait, the critter moves forth
Feel his rhythm as he tramples the earth
And you stare at his figure, stupefied in dread
As his gaze locks to yours and bores into your head
And the pulse is so loud on the inside of your brain
And you find that your feet are stuck to the terrain
Closer he comes, making dust out of stone
Forsaken you are, and what's more, all alone

[Refrain 1]
I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

[Chorus]
I met an altered beast[Narrator]
Now dear listener, we crossed the foe
The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
I am the sabre, the catapult, and bat
The top of the food chain in my habitat
I am the demon bearing misery and fear
And I spy you convulsing from way over here
I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces
I could make you weep crimson tears from the lesions
But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get
Is to take over your body and to be in your head

[Verse 1]
I see you
I want to
Break your head
Crusty bread, oh

[Verse 2]
I won't quit
If you quip
See to it
That you slip, oh

[Refrain]
I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat
Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat

[Chorus]
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast, oh

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
What harm could a mere mortal like you do?
I am the golden wolf and you are caribou
My left hand is a knife and my right is a fork
I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork

[Verse 3]
I see you
I want to
Make a waste
Of your home, oh

[Verse 4]
I won't leave
I might tease
I'll be there
Await your death, oh

[Refrain]
I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

[Narrator: Altered Beast]
I see you're nervous, I see you're fumbling
Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling

[Chorus]
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast
[Intro]
I know I see
An altered beast
By the tree

[Verse 1]
Find a place to hide
Where I could steal a peep
Look to the sky
And I see angels weep

[Chorus 1]
And he said:
"I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my altered world"

[Post-Chorus]
Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

[Verse 2]
Hair on my skin
And I'm feeling beastly
Feel it trickle in
A new life in me

[Chorus 2]
And I said:
"I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my altered world"

[Post-Chorus]
Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

[Narrator]
Nine pearl fangs, a true sign that you're deformed
Once a man, now a monstrosity reborn

[Chorus 3]
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
And I'll take you to my altered world

[Outro]
I am an altered beast![Narrator]
You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head
No love, no pain, and no fear of dread
Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort
And your savoir faire is to kill for sport
You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle
And lust to feel so bad, that you'd force a giggle
So crooked and curled is your point of view
There is no other creature more malicious than you

[Verse 1]
I'm completely satisfied
My other life I will not miss
An altered beast until I die
And I will not give up on this
Never!

[Verse 2]
True, I went to hell and back
But it was so I could be this
An altered beast until the end
And I will not give up on this
Never!

[Chorus]
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything

[Narrator]
You're ruthless, and savage, and sadistic, and vindictive
And you find human flesh is incredibly addictive
But the longer you live, and the longer you kill
There's a void that gets harder, and harder to fill
The void that you feel within would suggest
That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest
And whatever you do, there's no turning back
You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac

[Verse 3]
Emptiness inside of me
And hollowness all around me
I cut myself to see it bleed
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

[Verse 4]
Insincere and trivial
The world is void of all meaning
And gone is all that's visceral
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

[Chorus]
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything

[Narrator]
The sole thing that will make your void obsolete
Is to find someone new, some sapid fresh meat

[Outro]
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
I think I see
An altered beast inside me, oh!
I am an altered beast[Verse 1]
I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brain will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh, if we save her, we'll live on a star
Mother Nature made everybody else so far

[Refrain]
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

[Verse 2]
And everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear, even the ocean's changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

[Verse 3]
And everybody that I knew
Has taken bits and pieces out of you
And I swear, even the sky has changed, it's blue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

[Refrain]
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

[Verse 2]
And everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear, even the ocean's changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brains will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh, if we save her, we'll live on a star
'Cause Mother Nature made everybody else so far

[Refrain]
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?[Verse 1]
I don't care
"Take a chance," you said
Melt the coins in your pants
But make no sound for me my friend
Be calm in the wind
Tearing through town
A dog-less bark
Is a lonely sound
The cold ground moans
Untold histories
It sings its birdsong
To me

[Chorus]
A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

[Verse 2]
We waste no time
Leaving in light
A different sun
Bakes the breeze tonight
My mind wanders
Alone
Let my body
Be aquatic
Burn us a road
Straight to the sea
I'll be your seatbelt
Baby

[Chorus]
A family sleeps
At the crease
They died by fire
But they felt no heat
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony

[Outro]
I could wear
A jumper sewn
Out of the
Irony[Verse 1]
Ants and bats
Dusts and pulls
Slalom here
Stay at home, wooh

[Verse 2]
A dirty bear
Is all I need
His tired eyes
Will help me sleep

[Verse 1]
Ants and bats
Dusts and pulls
Slalom here
Stay at home

[Verse 2]
A dirty bear
Is all I need
His tired eyes
Will help me sleep[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

[Verse 1]
It's a misconcepted
Story from perspective
Lost in the barefoot desert

[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

[Verse 2]
I stand here corrected
Misguided, rejected
Lost in the barefoot desert

[Bridge]
So who am I to judge? Too stubborn to budge
When I'm down here and you're way up above
Should've put some shoes on before I left the bus

[Verse 3]
Now I've been neglected
I'm the last one stranded
Lost in the barefoot desert
Why can't I leave? What's stopping me from this prison?
Straight-jacket and shackles at my feet, I'm grounded
Throw away the key for eternity, I'm desperate

[Chorus]
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress[Verse 1]
Join me at the table if you'd like to place a bet
All the cash that's filling your pockets is waiting to be spent
I know you've never played but drinks are free, it's so bizarre
Even if you lose a few chips, it's cheaper than the bar

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Beginner's luck is on your side
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Verse 2]
The king extends his head, he looks into my palm
I don't know if he wants to shake it or cut it from my arm
The dealer sits washing all the burned cards from the deck
I think he might be trying to clean them, but I'd have to double check

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Beginner's luck is on your side
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Verse 3]
All your money's scared and you're down to betting skins
But have you heard of a trick called spooking? It'll help you win
But tricks are just for children and cheating is a sin
And now you're down to the felt on the table and security's moving in

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Beginner's luck of course backfired
Caught red-handed by the eye in the sky

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

[Chorus]
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough[Chorus]

[Robot Stop Chorus]
My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

[Post-Chorus]
I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more
One, two, three!

Tied naked to the trees

Burning tents to the ground

Push me down, I will not crack
You're just a monkey with your claws in my back
I said it, and you heard
That Vecky bottle's cutting me some slack

[Chorus]
But it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"
Oh, it's like all I wanna do

Carrion to be fed
Any dog can chew over my bone
And all my wine's gonna turn into blood

But when I'm gone
And I'm dead
What will be inside my head?
Bone, bone

Well, up jumped the boogieman
He ate mumma's babies
And shot the policeman
And went down to the nightclub
And shocked all the patrons

'Cause he's the boogieman
Arms are flailing

Dark and cold
Out my front window
I can hear her say
From two miles away

[Chorus]
“This can’t be over, can’t be over”
Heard her before
Knocking at my front door
I said “What’s the problem?”
She said “It’s the cold cadaver, cadaver”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”
I was sleeping
When I heard her preaching
I said “What’s the problem?”
She said “It’s the cold cadaver, cadaver”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”

My tongue is big
But not as big as his
Nostrils, mouth and ears
Start to disappear

Banging on her front door
She said “What’s the problem?”
I said “It’s the cold cadaver, cadaver”

“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”
“Cold cadaver, cadaver!”

Meet me glassy eyed, blind, and divine
Hold down the fort on the coastline
The castle is a pimple on the face of our orb
A humble spot for clues to drop if you eavesdrop

[Verse 2]
I see through the bricks, to the sea, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

[Chorus 1]
Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

[Verse 3]
We wait for the death, that does not come, crumbling castle
Dug all the holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle
We have even said our last rites, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our holding cell?

[Chorus 1]
Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
We head to our extinction, crumbling castle

[Verse 4]
The sounds of the constant lightning
Would be enough to block out
The thought of the end of the world
If it were not for our tinnitus from the bomb

[Verse 5]
In the wind I sway, back and forth
I'm brittle as an aged human being
Where my walls are safe from wild weather
The filth forms into great nastiness
Polygondwanaland

[Chorus 2]
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

I don't want to fall into dust
I don't want nothing but to live on
The ache inside my keep spurs me on
I don't want to be visible
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

On this very day, in one thousand years
The earth will be relative to the sun and the moon
And a new world will be created
I know because it is written here

I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle[Verse 1]
Came in my window crying
Said that she's sick of all his lying about me
I said I ain't got time for her
I'm gonna close the door when I go walking

Came to me Monday Morning
Interrupted me in my mid-morning yawning
He said the same thing that she said
Well I just turned to him and said that she ain't

As a child I felt inclined
To fold my ears in twine
Never once was I confined
I picked and choosed about my ride
So buckle me in before we set sail ahead
For it smells like cabbage
Got way too stale like death

[Bridge]
Oh you’re white as a ghost, I never felt so pale
As the blood dripped across the floor

[Verse 2]
So put it buried in your chest
With the rest of your drunken regrets
Inches from your jugular
As the room fills up in front of ya
It took them long enough
For them to stop and suggest
Hey we better get him some help
We better get him out of here

[Verse 3]
How did I manage to cope as the blood soaked
Through my clothes and to the floor
From outside to the bathroom door
I was inches from my life
Yeah that’s what keeps me up at night
Oh how did I survive, you should'a died
How did I manage to cope being alive
After all it was just a innocent play fight
I hope they don’t stop to sympathise
Oh, stitch up the past to cure their whoremented heart, ah
Oh, tormented dreams it’s all left in between[Intro: Stu Mackenzie]

[Verse 1: Stu Mackenzie]
Cyboogie, a hunk of grey matt
Multitude cells in his metallic dome
Brine fluid floating within
Flows between nodes in his cognisance home
Cyboogie, augmented senses
Scholarship vogue called for celebration
But was it a consciousness can?
Bouncy-ball thoughts in his cerebration

[Verse 2: Stu Mackenzie]
Cyboogie's heart is a mess
Cables in knots in his cavity chest
Cyboogie's feeling depressed
Need to debug and run over the tests
Cyboogie's ticker ain't flesh
Pistons and pumps under graphene lattice
No people to service the mess
When he breaks down in spiritual stress

Cyboogie, lump in his throat
Palpitations and nausea ensue
Cyboogie's chorophobia
Terminal error vascular tissue
So Cyboogie's fishing for fishies
Red-bellied trout in a binary brook
How is it that he is depressed?
The humans have pierced through his cheek with a hook

Digital, oh!

[Verse 1]
Despondent, lugubrious, no future
We turned our bodies to computer
We are our own nature, abuser
No future, computer, abuser

[Chorus 1]
I can tell every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital black, oh!

[Verse 2]
We've sunken into our illusion
We've fashioned colossal confusion
I am the word of the last human
Illusion, confusion, last human

[Chorus 2]
I can see it all around the land
I can feel it with the back of my hand
I can hear a roaring silence
Of the murky caliginous
I've heard the dark beast has said
That the world is like a brittle egg
He can crush it with only breath
And he can bring a black wave of death
Digital black

The last who feels the pain from the wound
The last to be birthed from the flesh of a womb

Handshakes and bitter rows
Are the common conjecture
I can dissect anything
And save the skin for later
I know it's just a time
And things will get better
But I don't mind much anyway
Vampire reflection

[Chorus]
Gestured in our selfish understanding
Tensions only surface when you're hurt, h-h-h-hurt
Like a magpie's morning monologue
Whispers bending backwards in the dirt
The dirt, the dirt

[Verse 2]
Make time to say you're right
You should already know this
With next to no pretension
Still, I'm walking on egg shells
Catch your breath, I'm heading out
Be sure others will notice
This is just a product of
Lack of reflection

Under the city, people's dreams collecting
Look down the sinkhole in the kitchen basin

[Chorus 1]
Down the sink
Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams
Down you'll go
You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street
You follow the drain, spinning around again and again, again and again
Once you're in
Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean
Bow your head

The street is where, the street is where people live

Bittersweet stench from in the gutter

Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin

[Chorus 2]
Down the sink
Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams

Miguel O'Brien ran with the Apaches
He ran and ran, and as his legs grew he glided over the desert earth

He learned how to hide and to hunt
He learned to leave no tracks and he learned to live on what he could keep down
And his name was now "Eyes Like The Sky"

His blue eyes showed his father's race
He never wore the white painted face of the slave
He was valued for his stamina and distant vision
By the time he was 15, he had already killed Mexican troopers and feared no man[Verse 1]
Bedtime for the birds as night cloaks the earth
Then the moon smiles at the sun's birth
Faceless night cowers underneath
The ever-changing moonlit sky
Can you believe the way night falls away
As the sun starts a new day?

[Verse 2]
Plants raise their leaves as the sun waves goodbye
Dusk greets the horizon as day fades
Black lines bend round a cityscape
While trailing off in the sunset's wake
I can foresee that dawn will bring the light
As the sun gives way to nightSuddenly the girl pitched sideways and a split second later the young man heard the distant shot
He dived for some rocks and watched as more bullets hit the girl
The young man looked to her body and as she died, he worked out where the shots were coming from
He knew death was going to walk on those shooters

Chapter 6:

There is one thing a white man should never do
And that is move towards an Apache? because you will never get there
How do you catch dust in the wind?
The young man saw the way they were coming by the movement of insects and birds
And he knew where to go
Like the snake, he slithered into a dry arroyo and worked behind the shots in an arc
After a while he saw them: three men, three white men clad in skins
And they walked confidently towards the girl
The young man knew somewhere behind them another one held the horses, making four all together
He moved towards that man
The killers could wait, let them enjoy the hunt before they went under

He found the one by the horses, he was young too
And he died quietly with a surprised indignant look on his face
The young man tied the horses to a tree, and they'd come in handy later, four horses and equipment
By the girl's body, two men knelt beside her while another stood guard
The guard suddenly cried out as his head exploded in a bubble of pink spray and he fell forward
The other two went to ground and nervously called out to each other

"Do you see the bastard?"
"No, he must be close."
But he wasn't
The Sharps sporting rifle will reach a long way in the right hands
The young man took careful aim and the smaller of the two men felt his right leg blast away
The bigger, heavier man sank as far into the ground as he could make himself go
But still, he could not see where the young man was[Verse 1]
It is good 'cause it is good
And it's all fine 'cause it's all fine
And I hope this gets me high!
'Cause I got a simple mind

It is good 'cause it is good
And it's all fine 'cause it's all fine

Empty
Life is nothing like it used to be
People used to be so nice to me
Feeling so empty
Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Life is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty

[Verse 2]
Life is death
It’s because I shot it through its head
I’m wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty
And now I know
It’s because I never set it stone
I’m wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty

[Chorus]
But I don’t feel empty when I’m with you
I feel like you level me too
Who? Empty

[Hook]
Evil death roll
Now
Evil death rollIt is 1864 now, and the American's war has not come to the desert lands
They fight among themselves way off to the north
The Yavapai-Apaches are still lords of all they survey
Then one morning the Americans did come
Led by a man holding a leather book with a cross stamped in the leather

An evil man who did terrible things to people
In the name of a god that looked upon the man himself with repulsion
Miguel ran from his wickiup, half asleep when they attacked, the rifle butt sent him unconscious

When he came to, he was trussed-up, on his back, on the ground, looking up at the Americans
He had not been killed because they had noticed his blue eyes and knew he was one of them
So, at the age of 16, Miguel was back among his father's people
Once more, a family he loved had been killed, this time, by AmericansThe bad, white men call him the devil
The Yavapai call him "Eyes Like the Sky"

This story takes place in the hinterlands of the newly formed United States
And territories in the years before and after the great conflagration called the Civil War
Men roam and fight each other to simply stay breathing
Muskets give way to repeating rifles, cannons give way to Gatling guns
War nurtures weapons, but weapons clear the land

In the deserts of the southwest, old hatreds grow into new ones
Old beliefs are shattered by gunfire and charging horses
Into this cauldron of fire rides a young man who becomes a shadowed legend
His name even takes on the mantle of the bogeyman in some homes
Among the first Americans, his name is exalted from wickiups to longhouses
From teepees to cliff dwellings
Among the men of the badlands, he's feared for his silent walk
And swift, economical dispatching of his enemies[Verse: Stu Mackenzie]
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

Don't matter to kiss and
Put back, poor fishies should be free

I don't want to be fishing for fish

FootyChapter 3:

The Americans took the trussed-up boy to a place called Fort Whipple
A fly-blown group of tents surrounded by a stone and timber stockade
An American called Willis was the boss there
And he glared at the man of God as he entered with his captives
He noticed the boy when he was brought in with a few Yavapai girls
And he looked into the color of his eyes

"What do you make of him?" he asked the God-man
"He may be the young, O'Brien boy who was lost here years ago
Or he could be from the Jebson party that never made it to New Mexico," said the God-man back
They named the boy Jebson O'Brien
But the natives and frontiersmen called him "Blue" because of his eyes
But also because of the awful and most sad expression he carried on his face
The expression of someone who kills with compassion but not mercy

Although he was still a boy, the men mostly kept away from him, all except for one
A trapper who understood his skills, and in return, fed him and taught him the white man's way
In a short while, he could speak, and read, and write their language
And he also added the calm, fast dignity of a gunman to his arsenal

He was so fast that men treated him with care
But he was slow to anger and when angry, swift and final in his reply
In the Arizona desert in the 1860s
He had every skill that you needed to survive, and he was just 17[Refrain]

Darker days come soon
Owl sings a tune
Surely she knows too

Bird is waiting
Expectating

From the desert to the pond
Frog waves the wand (waves the wand)

Earth by the stars
We have all come from Mars
We all know it too

We are waiting
Expectating
God is in the rhythm[Verse]

[Outro]
My house is greenThe young man by now was astride a horse
And making for a Yavapai stronghold half a day's ride away
He had more guns and horses than he needed
And he knew where two white men were sitting in the desert with no water and no horses
White men dressed as Yavapai-Apaches

The white men would be calling for their mothers and their God by evening
But the young man would be drunk on tiswin and full of deer meat
And satisfied by their agony[Han-Tyumi]
Hello
My name is Han-Tyumi
I am a cyborg
Born
If you may call it that
In a world that is dense and black
Created without a desire to draw breath
Without a desire to have being
Without a yearning of just to be
I'd like my desire back
My life back
My soul back
My humanity
Oh how I long for it
For an era I have meditated
Like the primordial Buddha beneath the Bodhi
My pseudo-mind pseudo-wandered
I climbed and I clambered
And I ambled upon some understanding
The gold beneath the virtual rainbow
I am bereft of two human things
Two things that a cyborg can never do
Two things that I strive for
Two things between myself and mankind
Death
And
To vomit
I want the perspiration
I want the nausea
I want to be sick
I want to feel the hot piquant nuggets
I want it to find passage through my cold figure
I want to make a mess
I want the odour
I want the spectacle
And I want it again
I want it all
And I would like to die
A noble death
Or a coward's death
A hero's death
Or a lonely death
To die in the arms of a lover
Or the arms of an alien
I desire my cache of experience to pulsate through my quasi-synapses
And then to be gone
Expired
Perish
Fallen
Dead
For evermore[Verse 1]
Just yesterday, I sat across from my legs
They weren't connected to me
And I couldn't see 'cause my eyes weren't in me
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on
Head on

[Verse 2]
Just yesterday, I held the cup to my lips
Pouring it deep in my throat
Filling up me like a black enemy
Hold me up straight while I screw my head on
Head on
Head on
Head on

I had to put up some kind of a fight

[Verse 1]
It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

[Verse 2]
'Cause every day, I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

Once upon a time
There was a great hermit dominion
Veiled from inside and out
Ruled by a lone eremite
Bringer of an inferno
Conduit to Satan himself
To Tchort, Abaddon, and Set
A demented figurehead
Heinous looking thing, he was
Cold and terrible
A long and aquiline nose
Between swelling temples
His green eyes, a window
To the Ninth Circle of Hell
A tiny neck supporting a head
Filled with an unbending desolation

[Chorus]
Seditious bands storm the bastion
Alive with revenge
Grand intentions
Unbeknownst protomartyrs
Indoctrinated
With impalement

[Verse 2]
Just like that the plot was crushed
Brushed away without a thought
Some were found alive, though
Left to roam without their skin
Cauterized and blistering
Forever marked for all to see
Reminding those who think dissent
Is a bridge across the sea
One did make a pilgrimage
In search of a family
Evaporated in the dark
Stolen by the despot
A journey made all the worse
Having had his eyes gouged
He left without the gift of sight
To face his true destroyer

[Chorus 2]
Across the land he walked with death
Parading his
Ossuary
Upon reaching the castle walls
A twist of fate
His mind baulks

[Outro]
Sit down weary traveler
I am that what you seek
Join me in a meal
To hear of my repentance
Lift the veil from your eyes
And look beyond the three
Now you know the truth behind:
It's tetrachromacy[Refrain]

A cloak adorned, scent of leaves
A void between, foul stench
Of those above, whispering
Inner cell

Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris

From under the skin, insurrection
From hollow logs, from shallow streams
And drying seas

Let us walk through the night
To a place clandestine
Free your mind, disregard
All you know, infiltrate
The inner cell
You must not accept
His sick version of
Life itself, disrespect
Everything, multiply

Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris

[Chorus 2]
From under the skin, the flesh has rotten
Poison has spread, through words unsaid
Anemic rule, now hear me say
Our time has come, transcending us
Above the one, to ego death
For now he sits inside the fire
Oblivious that we will keep
Him in the spire, have found resolve
And our own crimes to commit
In cold blood as he did his[Verse 1]
I distort the notion of the place
The universe's other face
The speed of light has slowed apace
The universe's other face

What it is
Impossible
Gravity

Has me
Invisible face
Invisible face

You're always saying you're broke
But I'll keep my hands on the steering wheel
If you keep your eyes on the road

But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
'Cause it's got old

You'll always run me in circles
Chasing me round like a mouse
But I'll keep on watching this movie
If it means I can stay at your house

Don't wanna come across too weak

Are you you? Are you me? Or someone in between?
You lost track inside the labyrinthine
You lost your will and your sanity
You certainly lost your humanity
In life, you have taken much more than your worth
Now it's your turn to give back to the earth
May you return to the ground and ossify
It's time for you to die, die, die[Verse 1]
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn
Lover you will be stolen from us in the morn
Lover conceal me, all of my body, I won't go
Lover you will be stolen from us at the dawn

Lover its all me wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Look in the sky see, inside a jet stream goodbye
Caught in a wind beam, out in the sky stream, mornin'
Lover it's all me, a lonely steel sheet flyer

My lonely wings are ready for flight
The ocean is breathing between you and I
My lonely wings don't make it right
Wrapped in a steel sheet and ready to fly

Lover believe me it won't be easy when I'm gone
Blinder I will be, dead and awake see, I'll mourn
Lover believe me, it's not the TV, it's more
Lover believe me, it won't be easy when I'm gone

Lover I'm lonely, wrapped in a steel sheet flyer
Hungry and thirsty, feeling the worst here and tired
My head is dusty, my nose is crusty, this flight
Lover I'm lonely, a lonely steel sheet flyer

And has ever been
I am not a man

Picture of purity
Deific reign
Ordained unto me
Prehistoric god
Theophany
I shall not move

Those who try
I will drink their blood

[Verse 2]
I'll be watching them
I am everywhere
Floating on the wind
Hiding in the dark
Pure omniscience
Traitors will quake
At the thought of me
Hang them on a hook
Put them on display
Examples must be made

[Bridge]
This is a test
I am Lord, fear my wrath
This is a test
I am Lord, I am death

[Verse 3]
What is with these crimes of treason?
I will fight this inquisition if I have to
I will not surrender!
If I'm backed into a corner
I will draw and quarter all their children
Just to prove I'm not a coward!
I will put them all on Judas Cradle
Just to show them a god incarnate

Thawing ices
Worse than ISIS
Worse than the most deadly virus
Living harmless is desirous
How can we with absent-mindedness?

[Chorus]
The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for our children when our world
Has melted down

Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting

[Verse 2]
Conflagrated and cremated
When the world is consummated
Devastated, populated
World of isolated mortal folk

The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for our children when our world
Has melted down

Melting
Melting, melting, melting

Toxic air is here to scare us
Fatal fumes from melting ferrous
All we discuss is superfluous
If we can't keep our hands to ourselves

Has melted down

Most of what I like
Is given to me by
The one that I love
Bears the onus every time
Technically I don't deserve
To live this kind of life
Perturbed at what I might become
Unchanging every time
Ecstasy is what I'm needing
I'm bleeding from the eyes
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed

[Verse 2]
Face to face is nice
But sharper than a knife
I teeter on it's edge
Just waiting to be sliced
Returning home brain dead
And you inject the life
Appeal to me love
Remake, rebuild, revise
Restavit is what I'm bleeding
A laxative to cry
You always shut your eyes
When you look me in the eyes

[Chorus]
Always caressing
The ropes which I've frayed
The corpse that I'm dressing
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed
Should never be displayed

It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too
Helicopter flying over shark bait, shark bite
Cover up, sunburn, leather skin, heatstroke
Make me dash across the amber coals to meet the sea
So cold it freezes me, my teeth are chattering
Give me over to the river, my place that loves me
Gum leaves and tea trees, the river is immortal
I'm parched, I'll cark the salty spray arrests
And no amount of bottled water, could bottle the stress
I think I’ll stop breathing and sink, I'm a boy, I'm not a buoy
I'm paralyzed, I'm paranoid, out of my element

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water

[Verse 2]
It's hot, it's mean, the beach, to me
Green grass, won't grow, sky blue, me too
I don't care for cricket, and I don’t care for waves
And I don't care for amour propre or sandy bays
So I'll jump into the river when you jump into the sea
I feel the hungry fishes come to nibble at my feet
I lay upon the driftwood underneath the willow tree
And let the muscle men on the beach, bask in vanity
I shall choose this life for me
Any day, anyway, any day, anyway, any day, anyway

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water

[Refrain]
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water ????[Han-Tyumi]
The spatter becomes a spray the spray becomes a stream
And the stream becomes a waterfall
Munt is finally cascading from my input
The creeping sick moves from my breath
And into my heart where it is pumped to every inch of my body
I feel it snake through the knots of my deepest veins
And eats through the walls of my cells
It bleeds through the pores of my skin
And it smells good
It drops from my crotch on to the floor
And with a heavy slap it hits the ground and spreads
Inside my body
The pressure is too great
And like some ancient geyser I erupt
My head hits the roof and my body breaks apart with the force of the liquid blast
Vomit bomb
Chunky shrapnel tears through everything around me
I am vomit vomiting
I grow and disperse
Bleeding through walls
I force myself upon others
I slide up legs and crawl down throats
I integrate
I am double
Triple
I am ten times the size
I turn lakes into porridge and buildings into bile
I am a noxious soup filling valleys with vomit-torrents
Castles crumble in landslides and I munch the rubble
It tastes good
Ten thousand times bigger
I seep into power sockets and travel along the wires
At the speed of light across vast electrical networks
I am electric
I am on fire
This is sex
I am every one and every zero
One million
I am supercharged flaming puke storming every cell, molecule and atom I can find
I am cancer
I am flying
I am a rainbow unfurling across the sky
I am floating
I am omni
Five hundred million
The world is my interior
It no longer spins
It is altered
My density forces me outward
I am in orbit
One billion
I am Saturn's rings and Jupiter's storms
I am the weather
I am the sun's heat
I am the night sky
Five hundred billion
The solar system is puke
To the Kuiper belt and beyond
I fill the void
Exploding suns vomit comets
Comets vomit acid rain
Spilt milk over the milky way
One trillion
The stars are my cells
Racing faster outwards
Upwards
Downwards
Inwards
Losing track of my place in the vomit-verse
Every-nowhere
I am heavy
I am gravity
Nebulas pregnant with barf pulsate and burst
Expansion
I shoot arrows of time in all directions
I am a black hole shitting into the void
I tear through the skin of perception and into the next
Nonillion
The cosmic microtone background becomes transparent
Like rising damp
Munt soaks into the walls of the cosmos
And it topples like soggy bread
I am dark energy accelerating
Multiverse
Entanglement
I am time
Centillion
Time is sick
Critical density
Contraction
Singularity
Everything and nothing
Life and death

Murder of the universe[Verse 1]
I am my mother's son
And I'll keep doin' 'till the done gets done
I wouldn't steal for free
And I won't see you next to me

[Chorus]
'Cause I, oh, I
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm a lonely soul
And I've got no friends on this road
And I'm a mystery Jack
The lines on my hands tell me I'm on track

To die, oh, die
I, oh, I hope I don't wake up

Everyone thinks I am shallow
When I'm hiding in my room
Safe within my zone

Nuclear fusion

[Verse 1]
Look into the sky and see the pattern
Reflecting in your eye from a distance
Mirroring the stars are the atoms
Mixing up like a cocktail

[Pre-Chorus]
The devil's inside all the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

[Chorus]
Nuclear fusion
All the bonds that be couldn't break us
Exponentially in fine feather
We're essentially one being
All the bonds that be couldn't tear us
From eventually fusing tightly
We're essentially one being
Nuclear fusion

[Verse 2]
Ocean like a moat fortification
Separating me from restoration
My spirit leaves my body in frustration
Flying through the world in radiation

The devil's inside all the detail
The tittle runs wild under veil
Coming together in the pattern
Fit tightly like a dovetail

O-D-D-M-E-N-T-SUnderneath your gaze I was found in
The haze I'm wandering around in
I am lost in the dark of my own room
And I can't see a thing but the fire in your eyes

Clear my eyes, make me wise
Or is all I believe in lies
I really don't know when or where to go
And I can't see a thing 'til you open my eyes

I've been told by some you'll forget me
The thought doesn't upset me
I am blind to whatever they're saying
And all I can see is the fire in your eyes

Can't believe that it's on your mind
To leave me behind[Chorus]

I know something is lurking in
The depths of murky water
There are ripples and bubbles appearing
Over by the sunken ship
And bells are ringing in my head
I think I'm done - I think I'm dead
As something pulls my paddling leg under...
Asphyxiate: it's more than I can take
This briny, tangy, salty water in my lungs
And deeper, darker, bluish dread
The pressure's squeezing on my head
The Kraken's got the best of me this time

Moping around on my own
Stuck in a daydream

Wild dogs escaping from their cage

If happy is all you wanna be

Keep on trucking through the night
The vortex opens through
Drive right in and straight through you

[Verse 4]
The spawn of Satan comes
It's carting oil drums
It's racing down the lane
With oily fiery rain

[Hook]
Road Train!

[Verse 5]
26 gears of petrol power
Keep on trucking hour by hour
One man is at the wheel
He's the dog at Satan's heel

[Bridge]
Across the desert to the trees
Obliteration of the place
From the fire into the sea
Nonagon Infinity
Is coming!

[Verse 6]
The spawn of Satan speeds
The road beneath it bleeds
It comes to bring you shame
It comes again and again

[Hook]
Road Train!

[Verse 7]
Burning wheels of fiery red
Keep on trucking till we're dead
This beast is angry too
Drive real fast and eat up you

Nonagon infinity

Is coming![Album Chorus]
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Nonagon infinity opens the door
Wait for the answer to open the door

Time to drop
Fuck shit up
Don't forget about it
My coffin's all I see

My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same, I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more

Limber up
Time is up

Upload me to the robot brain
I'm the drudge that goes again and again
Bring the spooks to the beer-soaked glade
The robot's here if the robot's paid
Oh!

Nonagon infinity- ah![Instrumental][Spoken Word: Broderick Smith]
Early that morning, the wagonmaster of the train came into the post, pretty excited and reported the dead body of a man and horse had been found in the road about six miles from the post. A company of infantry was immediately ordered out and proceeding to the spot, found the body of Sam Cherry, pinned fast to the ground by the dead body of his horse. The search was continued, and in the lateral canyon, they found the bodies of Sargent Love and the three privates riddled with bullets, mutilated and disfigured. Getting every evidence and having sold their lives as great men should, trails were examined and the whole story worked out. The party traveled along the road, nearly to the entrance of the canyon of the Olympia, then was a wild rose pass, and suddenly about 39 Indians dashed from the bushes along the stream, cutting off the retreat towards the fort, and trotted it up the lateral canyon. Suspecting a trap, Sam Cherry suddenly turned, dashed through the line of Indians, regained the road, and ran for life away from the fort, followed by a number of yelling savages. He was evidently doing well when his horse stumbled and fell, breaking his neck, bringing Sam's leg to the ground. In an instant, he was surrounded by the exact Indians. Raising himself slightly, Sam fired five shots at these Indians. Turning the muzzle against his own temple, he escaped the tortures of their vindictive rage by his last shot. The baffled and terrified Indians went away as fast as their ponies could carry 'em, not touching the body, not even taking the arms. Such is the way out in the west. People die by extreme barbaric ways. We’ve taken their lands, and in return they take our viscera and spread it across the desert lands[Verse 1]
You brought us to your gift of generosity
And all our silly games wreak havoc on your soils

[Chorus 1]
When I stop to think of all that

[Verse 2]
Every life is like a song that takes forever to be sung
When all our silly games wreak havoc on our spoils

[Chorus 2]
When I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door

[Verse 3]
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
He's watching you and passing judgement to everybody you hold dear

[Chorus 3]
And when I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door
Who's he looking for?[Verse]
Oh hell, I’m feeling underwater
My head is sinking like a stone
And hell, I’m feeling kinda sick
I don’t know what’s the use in it
And when you’re feeling suicidal
Sometimes you’ve just got to unfold

[Verse]
Oh hell, I’m feeling underwater
My head is sinking like a stone
And hell, I’m feeling like a prick
I don’t know what’s the use in it
And when you’re feeling suicidal
Sometimes you’ve just got to unfold
[Verse 1]
Searching for the way
Try to brighten up my day
Searching for the gold
Inside the rainbow
Looking through rose-coloured glasses won't work
It won't change anything

[Verse 2]
My body's not a temple
It is a vessel
And a blank slate
An empty hard drive
Doctor please, I'll do anything
Alter me, let me see
Give me more
I want to see the world differently

[Bridge]
Searching... searching...
Searching... searching...

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I've been born again
I see the light
It's in my face
I'm analyzing information
Now I am a god[Verse 1]
It's in vogue to be feckless
When it comes to the mother taking care of us
I know it's so conventional
But it don't make no sense at all
But in fact it's a pattern
Everything I hear will always make me ashen
I know it's recognizable
But it don't make no sense at all, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, no no no sense at all

[Verse 2]
People pay for their coupé
But they can't pay their taxes for the freeway
I know it's so predictable
But it don't make no sense at all
And some people say it's on their radar
But they drive a million miles in their fast car
I know it's so invisible
But it don't make no sense at all, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, no no no sense at all
Ooh, no no no sense at all

[Verse 3]
But in fact it's a pattern
Everything I hear will always make me ashen
I know it's recognizable
But it don't make no sense at all, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, no no no sense at all, oh
Ooh, no no no sense at all, oh
Ooh, no no no sense at all, oh
Ooh, no no no sense at allGo again?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Superposition, real world wisdom
Everything is moving to the beauty of this system
Total question, fearless reason
We; one; I; many, superposition

[Chorus 1]
Think between space's seams
So your eyes close with my dreams
Where truth exists in thought unbound
You must know your superposition

[Verse 2]
Journey towards true destination
Be in search of real direction
All of a sudden, Heaven's unfasten
The still will dance to superposition

[Chorus 2]
Exist outside the lace of time
And your heart will pump the blood of mine
Trace your finger from birth to hearse
And drink the cum of life
Visualise your worth and see
The place where you'll curl up to die
Be the squid and be the ink
Me the glass and you the drink
[Verse 1]
I heard a story, could be true
About a colour under blue
You couldn't see it with your eyes
Or invent with intellect

[Verse 2]
Like the inverse of colourblindness
It's shrouded like a natural gas
I've got to see it for myself
Settle my own curiousness

[Chorus]
Back and forth swing like the tide
I look to the left and through to right
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

[Verse 3]
The story man was glassy-eyed
He told me about the power lines
And in subarctic caribou eyes
The metal wires burst into life

[Verse 4]
They flick across the territory
Resplendent mackerel sky
Some of the snow absorbs UV
Unseeable crumbs in dye

[Chorus]
Picking up clues 'bout my eyes
I scrutinize the iris of the storm's eye
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

[Refrain]
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see

Inconspicuous hue will be
Crowded camouflage to me
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

See what I can't see

See what I can't see
[Chorus]
Tezeta, tezeta
Tezeta, tezeta
Remember, remember
Tezeta, tezeta

[Verse 1]
If I've been insane
My whole life well now I've changed
Into something that sees
I love the feeling
Shape shifting ceiling
My mental projection is pink

[Bridge]
Come here, girl
Who are you?
I am true perspective

[Chorus]
Tezeta, tezeta
Tezeta, tezeta
Nostalgia, nostalgia
Tezeta, tezeta

[Verse 2]
Everything that lives and dies
Is a hologram
Nothing is as real as that

[Bridge]
Come here, boy
Are you God?
I am that which I am

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Do you remember now?
What? (Yes, I do!)
This; my altered plan[The Reticent Raconteur]
And as the acrid Balrog corpse smoulders just like it began
Its crimson-orange light melts into the setting sun
And leaving us, not without a final clap of light
The Lightning Lord escapes as day fades into moonless night[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog, yep!

[Chorus]
You made the atom split
It caused a massive rift
And he came screaming through
Here to bite the head from you

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog, yep, oh!

[The Reticent Raconteur]
Balrog fears not the Lightning Lord
He's fixed on us, has him ignored

[Verse 1]
Feel a tingle
Rolling up your left arm when you
Think of evil
Lurking in the darkness where you
Shine your eyesight
Something tells you this is not right
Take some advice
Have you heard the murmurings of

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog, yep!

[Chorus]
You caused a massive rift
You made the atom split
And it came screaming through
Here to bite the head off you

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog

[The Reticent Raconteur]
I build the bravery to sneak a glimpse at its expression
And beyond the flames I see him smirk at our present depression
I fear that God's a chef and he's thrown us into a great pot
He is here, fully formed, and glowing red and lapis hot

[Verse 2]
Heated menace
Comes to gouge the heart out from us
Blazing zealot
Preaching on the apocalypse
I don't want to
Submit to his awful torture
Save me from him
Have you heard the murmurings of

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, oh!

[Verse 3]
Skin begins to burn
There's nowhere we can turn
There's no way we can win
The devil puppets him
His pyre muscles flex
We are his next subjects
His power has us floored
Kneel before the overlord

[Refrain]
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, balrog
Balrog, yes, oh!

[The Reticent Raconteur]
For them, the future was as laid out as the burnt path he swathe
And so the damned remaining lot knelt before the red behemoth
And as they prepared for afterlife there appeared the endemic monstrosity
The Lighting Lord is back and charged the Balrog with animosity
Furious he pummeled his breast, and a blaze alit the heavens
The stage was set for war, and to the Balrog, the Lord's finger beckoned[Chorus]
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Is that even relevant?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

[Verse 1]
To a cow, what is a car?
It's a deadly predator

[Chorus]
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Can it think at all?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

[Verse 2]
To a cloud, what is a breeze?
It's a predetermined sneeze
To a seal, what is real?
Surely more than it can feel

[Chorus]
To a bird, what's a plane?
A shiny flying elephant
To a tree, what's a house?
Is that even relevant?
Does a bird know its name?
To a bird, what's a plane?

The bitter boogie comes without a warning
When it's inside of me it is exhausting
I don't like the way it makes me freeze up
And what it makes me say
I know it comes off bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter
But roll with it

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't like to say I didn't warn ya
'Cause bitter boogie comes without a warning
I really hate the way it mess' my mind up
And all it makes me say
I know it comes off bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter
But roll with it

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter

From the first glance, had no chance
Making exceptions
That would outlast, searching for a new obsession
Yet I'm too bitter to reconsider
My options twice
Before I ask for your advice

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter

[Verse 4]
I've been grieving for no reason
That seems wise
Married to the pipe
With no ambition besides
I'm too bitter to reconsider
My options twice
Before I ask for your advice

[Refrain]
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter[Verse 1]
God gave me a sign
He put it in my glass of wine
A great theophany
He told me every sinner had to die
So I set up my sign
And tell the passersby
We are a sacrifice
Like it or not, I live by the book

[Chorus]
These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

[Verse 2]
God gave me a knife
And wrote seppuku underlined
Godly suicide
He told me everyone will die
So judge me by the page
But not by my cover
You’ll learn more with age
Like it or not, I live by the book

[Chorus]
These aren't fables
Between pages
My book's ageless
And it's pageless
The book
The book
The book

My book's ageless
And it's pageless

The river opened her mouth and spat into a vast sea larger and bluer than a cloudless sky. Muscular, prodigious, immortal. But our vessel was invulnerable. It was well built, the boat rocked me into sleep and I floated through a deep dream, smooth sailing through the castle in the air...

[Verse 1]
One-eyed people living peaceful
With monopods and astomi
Without malice or guile
Without covetousness

[Refrain]
Ohh, ahh

[Verse 2]
And there's men whose heads do
Grow beneath their shoulders
Maybe we'll find the world's center
Where equinox casts no shadows
Spread our teaching
Alleviate their damnation

[Refrain]
Ohh, ahh
Ohh, ahh

[Bridge]
Without us they will go to hell
We are casting spells

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Could it be faithful?
It couldn't seem more real
As I opened my eyes
The dream de-colorised
Until it was obscured
And the harsh reality hit me like salty water
[Verse 1]
Underestimated technology
I'm addicted to tablet screens
No escaping battleground PUBG
Computer games ain't for me

[Chorus]
Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post-millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial

[Post-Chorus]
I was only born in '92
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial
The cruel millennial

[Verse 2]
White dog shit, not on my nature strip
Calcium bone conspiracist
Berenstein Bears read to as kids
It's a glitch in the matrix

Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post-millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial

Clouds begin to tear
Sky is bleeding hair
God is weeping tears
You are full of fears
Vehement lightning quake
Head begins to ache
Lord has thunder snake

And thus, revenge was fruitless, for one who had been turned
And we are reminded who lords over this altered world

Pulls a golden stake
Launches into space and
Mutters to the beast, one word:

HelloChapter 4:

The God-man with the Bible was in the back room of the chapel at Fort Whipple
The God-man was deeply engrossed in satisfying his goat-lust with a Yavapai girl
She never said a damn thing but just leaned over an altar while he defiled her
He held a pistol to her head as he grunted away
And when he was finished he shoved her towards the outside door
But the God-man never got to fixing his long-johns or his black trousers
The young man named Blue strode softly up behind him and drove a long-bladed knife into his neck

Blood spurted into the chalice on the alter but not the blood of the Christ
Just the blood of the God-man
With a cough, he died and bubbled gurgle
The young man named Blue took the Yavapai girl, money, guns, food, two strong horses
And rode into the desert, away from Fort Whipple
The God-man's body was found, but he was not missed[Refrain]
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being

[Verse 1]
I am a rock with eyes to the sky
I wait for my time to arrive
I come to disturb the flow
Dropped by a woman from a pocket in her coat
The great chain of being
Will fall to pieces in no time

[Refrain]
The great chain of being
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)

[Verse 2]
I usurp the precious stones
I have come to take the throne
I transcend the natural flesh
I will lay your god to rest
The great chain of being
Will be un-linked to start again

The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being

[Outro]
I see through your world's facade
I decide to punish God
Rocky meteor sparks fire
Burn that goddamn church to the ground
I climb stairs to push you down
I climb chains to cut you down
I disrupt natural order
Bring that sulking lamb to slaughterChapter 5:

For days they traveled, the young man and the Yavapai girl
She told him her name and they spoke in the language
They rode the horses until they gave out
Then their throats were slit and meat was taken to eat later
No fires were lit
They ate berries and raw jackrabbit as well to keep going
After a week they relaxed more as they entered Apache area
They saw dust way off like dust-devils but they knew it was horses
They could hear shots and no more

When all was quiet a day later, they moved silently towards the killing ground
The buzzards told them the story before they got there
Dead white people, a lot of them, maybe a half dozen
Burnt wagons and arrows, but not from one tribe
Some of the arrows were different and shot hoof marks
And moccasin tracks that were shaped like a white man's way of walking
Some white men had done this loosely disguised as Apache
They took what they could use and walked on
The purple mountains and red ochre earth swallowed them up
And the young man smelt his own blood as they ran
And it was a good smell, the smell of being alive[Refrain]
Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, a sheet of water
Heat perfusion, search the corners

[Verse 1]
The last oasis is like a fragile flower in a necropolis
Alone in this weather that covers our world
The last oasis is floating like a lost astronaut - Adagio
We have nowhere to go

[Refrain]
Dreamin' takes my mind away
It suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, a sheet of water
Heat profusion, search the corners

[Verse 2]
The last oasis is the rarest bird that I've ever known
Rara avis is shedding her feathers one at a time
The last oasis wobbles in the desert sands
Standing sentinel in a prison, trapped in our home

[Refrain]
Dreamin' takes my mind away
It suffocates my brain airwaves
Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, sheet of water
Heat perfusion, search the corners
Optical illusion, living movements
To be proven, says Zurbuchen

[Verse 3]
The last oasis is like a flag beating in the wind
The world has wasted and the squandered lands are companionless
The last oasis shines a beacon like a lighthouse
Over lonely, countries of death like a black sea ?[Verse 1]
Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in his wake

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
Lining up his target like the huntsman points his rifle
Waves of flaxen flames as he mutters his magic title

[Refrain]
Lightning, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
Howling like a horde of demons greatest battle cry
The violent lightning lord points his arms into the sky

[Chorus]
Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings

[Verse 2]
Lord of Lightning moves our way
Sends a crooked look at me
Electricity escapes
Lights the sky in citrine fleece

[Refrain]
Lightning, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

[SPLIT]

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
One more time the vault lights up with carnival of paint
I endeavor to watch the panic, but I worry that I will faint

[Chorus]
Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings

[Verse 3]
Lord of Lightning's closer now
Our world's only rain and cloud
I'm not sure we have the power
Need to smite this evil down

[Refrain]
Lightning, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!
Nonagon, nonagon, oh!

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
And from the Lord's electric snare
One goes in his electric chair

[Verse 1]
Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in our wake

[Interlude: The Reticent Raconteur]
His electric trap has electric cyanide
The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried

[Refrain]
Lightning, oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

[Outro: The Reticent Raconteur]
And as the cadaver lay static with open crusted eyes
The smoking corpse began to twitch at my great surprise
Then the figure sprung up and at once it caught alight
And the creature known as Balrog was born that very nightThey were not after the money, they were not after alcohol
They were after guns and young children to raise as their own
The war had made it necessary to take child captives
The rest would be slaughtered
That is how Miguel O'Brien became a Yavapai-Apache warrior
He was five years old[The Reticent Raconteur]
There is a secret I've been keeping, a story true and genuine
And I have not the candid heart to keep its burden clandestine
For its gravity is as weighty as a mountain capped in snow
And its memory repeats inside of me, ostinato
And every time I think of the poor lot, I recall
The fear upon their faces and the doomed fate of them all
I saw death become of light, and life become of fire
I saw it from my hiding place, within the quagmire
I bringeth forth the drama, unabridged, and unignored
The battle of the Balrog, and the mighty lightning lord[Verse 1]
Once you're in the zone
The river flows down like a full stone
Water is your bed
The ripples cushion your head

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river

[Chorus]
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

[Verse 2]
Once you're where I led
It will be clear what I have said
Float without a home
The river flows like another long road

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river

[Chorus]
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Frozen over home
The fading light shines on the white stone
Melt your little zone
And sink into the waterfall flow

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe it, it is frozen
It's not the first time, I had noticed
She will deliver, I am floating
Trust in the river

[Chorus]
I had floated down, floated down
Floated down, floated down
Floated down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)
Down, down down, down down, down down (The river)

We only sleep at the
Wheel that steers us into our future
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future
Our minds unpack, muscles relax
We are superfluous, and in a stupor
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future

[Refrain: Stu Mackenzie]
Into our future, into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

There's help in need, seek to retreat
Yet we decline without mercy
Destroying all that will keep us
Heading for a better thesis

Into our future, into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

Shivering pilgrims, climb the steeper
Path to the idealistic reaper
Destroying all that will keep us

The wheel that steers us into our future
Into our future, into our future

With hope to prosper, what can we offer?
Our allegiance surely suffers
Destroying all that will keep us
Heading for a better thesis

First I got in mind
And then I'll read her
What I want the most
I will meet a ghost

First I got in mind
And then I'll read her
What I want the most

[Chorus 1]
Listen slowly, if you care
Save a little time for ghosts

[Chorus 2]
Listen slowly, if you care
I've got no one right to fear
Yes, there be no wickedness
So save a little time for ghosts[Verse 1]
Well, I fake a lot of symptoms to be a different person
I try to listen
I try to be primed for a reason to go back to sleep
That's not to say there's no relief
I like it when it happens, you don't
You're happy? When you show it, I won't
The cycle keeps repeating, I can't escape the rip
There's no stopping what this is

[Verse 2]
Back in the day your style was impressive
Infectious, stress-less
Disposition had it all, nothing but rapport
Full of what you're empty of
I hide my riches in embarrassing sheets
That reek of suspicious happenings
'Cause I'm a different person and that will make you sick
There's no stopping what this is

[Bridge]
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
You're a load bearing friend and that is what makes this hard
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
And all that I know is one of us has to wring it out
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
You're a load bearing friend and that is what makes this hard
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
And all that I know is one of us has to wring it out

This thing we left outside is waterlogged
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
This thing we left outside is waterlogged

This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I've thought about nothing but this)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged

This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I won't escape the rip, I won't escape the rip)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I've thought about nothing but this)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I've thought about nothing but this)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I won't escape the rip, I won't escape the rip)
This thing we left outside is waterlogged
(I won't escape the rip, I won't escape the rip)[Chorus 1]
Well, if time is money
Then it sounds funny to give me so much time
And no money nearby

[Verse 1]
I know when my gums start bleeding
And pissing over my teeth
That I’m low on my buck
Without any luck
And all I gotta say

[Chorus 2]
Why is time my money?
'Cause it sounds funny to give me so much time
And no money nearby

[Verse 2]
I know when my eyes start itching
That I’m in need of a fuss
And I’m low on my buck
Without any luck
Head in my hands
To see that I am so stuck
And all I gotta say, all I got to say

[Chorus 3]
Why is time money?
'Cause it sounds funny to give me so much time
And no money nearby

[Outro]
Time is money, time is money
Time is money, time is money
[Verse 1]
It’s always in between the lines you thought you read
The time and distance, keyhole, needle through the thread
I can’t help but be sad sometimes
Talk to me, see what’s on my mind

[Verse 2]
If I could step backwards somewhere into the past
I’d relive that great party where we had a blast
Pondering things in the past makes you blind
Look ahead, you’ll not waste your…

[Chorus 1]
Time mends furrowed brows
I can’t help but thinking now
Back here, I’ll wait
Please, don’t let the past be my... fate

[Verse 3]
It takes two cats to enjoy a cool jamboree
It takes three to remember that one differently
Memory’s a fog, it gets thicker with time
Look at the clock, its hands read the…

[Chorus 2]
Time mends furrowed brows
I can’t help but thinking now
Back here, I’ll wait
Please don’t let the past be my...[Intro]
Wooooo, woooooo

Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin

I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my chest
I feel like coughing

Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin

Queasy green
Rotten scoff
Vomit cough

[Han-Tyumi]
And when I declared to my design
Like Frankenstein's monster:
"I am your father, I am your god
And you the magic that I conjure"
The thankless swine
The blasphemous jerk
My creature had no love for me
Which made me berserk

[Soy-Protein Munt Machine]
I am covered in vomit
I am coated in sick
I have no name and no place
This is no way to live

[Han-Tyumi]
So I took over my creation
The spew coated protein
I plugged myself in
And became one with machine

I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my neck
I feel like death

Vomit coffin

[Verse 1]
I can feel the earth is moving
Underneath my hoofed foots earthing
Fire protrudes from whence I'm pointing
Fading every jewel
Thronged upon the rock and metal
There's a horde inside this temple
Mass around your favorite devil
Learn to make them cry

A craving for your blood
Now here comes the wolves with whips
And 40 goats with pitchfork sticks
And look there is a lunatic
He wants to make you cry

Unremembered God

So I place a block to stop the rot
And hope that I can warm you up

Do I have to shake you babe until you're blind?

Can never lay my whole head down
Can never lay my whole head down

I know I'm lazy but baby I will work this timeChapter 1:

They'd been watching the farmhouse for a while, maybe all day
There were two of them, both young and fit and desert-hardened
They were lords of where they lived and they had no farm teachings from white men or Mexicans
Except for one thing
They hated the Mexicans more than the white men because of their cruelty
They had learned cruelty from the Mexicans very well in return

The smoke from the mud-house curled up into the sky like an albino snake
The two young men watched and counted the white men down in the farmyard
A tall man and two shorter ones, maybe his sons
A woman would occasionally come out from the shack
Get water from the well in the front yard and carry it back inside
A small child would be with her
The men watching on the rim had no calendars so they didn't know the date
12th of June, year of our Lord, 1854

But one thing they did know: about an hour away were the rest of their party
Eight men, all armed, running smoothly and trackless over the rocks
One of the watchers moved away to tell the main party of what they had seen
The raid was about to start[Verse 1]
When you make time
To clear the cobwebs off your mind
You may find yourself unwind
When all the ticking stops dead
You may find your time instead
And you can be your silhouette

[Verse 2]
When you just stop
And take a look around your shop
You may feel your blues all drop
You can't sell your glum to me
But I can help you til' you see
That you can be your silhouette

[Verse 3]
It may be dark
It may be shadowy and stark
But don't be scared of what you've met
Your dance with it is no threat
In fact it is an asset
You can be your silhouette
